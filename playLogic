principles:

1. If at the beginning of the circle, be more cautious, rather drop. Small/Big Blind is Risky to play even with good cards.
2. Compare myBet with Total POT + win chances
3. Check how many players are at the table



int position == return the position within the round;

HAND PRIORITY:
high card
one pair
two pairs
three of a kind (drill)
offsuited - straight
flush (suited)
full house
four of a kind (poker)
Straight Flush - suited straight
Royal Flush (ending with A)



WHAT IS IN MY HAND IN THE CURRENT TURN (1-10 rank)

WE SHOULD CHECK OUR CURRENT HAND FROM STRONGEST TO LOWEST!


*************HIGH CARD***************
Do I have in my hand the HIGHEST or 2nd HIGHEST CARD?
    If (perPlayerBET < 4x of BLIND) {
        --> call; }
    else { pass; }


*************PAIR***************

1. My cards are pair?
    1. Is the value ABOVE Q?
        --> raise max(POT, 10x of BLIND);
            --> was there a reraise?
                --> int reraiseRate = (enemyReraise/POT)
                    --> reraise POT * (1/reraiseRate)
                        --> is there a second reraise/call?
                            --> call or check;

    2. Is the value ABOVE 8?
        --> raise max(POT, 10x of BLIND);
            --> was there a reraise?
                --> int reraiseRate = (enemyReraise/POT)
                    if (reraiseRate < 1) {
                        --> reraise POT * (1/reraiseRate)
                            --> is there a second reraise/call?
                                --> call or check; }
                    else { call; }

    3. Is the value BELOW 9?
        --> raise max(POT, 10x of BLIND);
            --> was there a reraise?
                --> call;


*************TWO PAIR***************
    1. If my HAND PAIR is not part of the two highest PAIR {
        --> check / pass }

    2. Is my hand a pair? --> to see if the second pair is on the board or mixed with my hand
        --> if yes, is my HAND PAIR higher vs. BOARD PAIR?
            --> Is the Kicker (5th card) higher then my PAIR?
                --> was there a raise before me?
                    --> if (myBet vs POT) > 0.2 {
                            call }
                        else { pass }
                --> else { raise POT/2);
            --> else (I am the kicker) {
                --> raise POT;

    2b. Else (so the two pairs are mixed with my hand) {
        --> RAISE POT }


*************Three of a kind***************
    1. If my HAND is PAIR (
